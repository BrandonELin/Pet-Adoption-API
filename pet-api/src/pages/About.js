            <h2>About Our Agency</h2>
            <p>One rainy evening, our founder Brandon happened upon a small kitten huddled under a cardboard box. He quickly grabbed the kitten and rushed into the warmth of his home. After inspection, Brandon saw the kitten was fine. He wrapped the kitten in a blanket and promised himself that from that day forth, he would save as many of the homeless, rainsoaked animals as he could.</p>
            <p>In collaboration with co-founders Kristy, Mamdouh, and Jessica, our pet rescue and adoption agency was created, with the goal of getting all animals their forever homes.</p>
